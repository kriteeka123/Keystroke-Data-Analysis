Overview
Keystroke dynamics is a behavioral biometric that analyzes typing patterns to identify users, detect anomalies, or classify individuals based on their typing behavior. This project leverages machine learning to analyze keystroke data, extract key features, and build predictive models for user authentication or anomaly detection.  

Features  
- Collect and preprocess keystroke data (key press/release times, typing speed, latency).  
- Extract meaningful features such as dwell time, flight time, and typing rhythm.  
- Train and evaluate ML models for classification, anomaly detection, or authentication.  
- Provide insights into user behavior through keystroke dynamics.  

Technologies Used 
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Machine Learning Models (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)  
- Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

How It Works 
1. Data Collection: Captures key press and release events.  
2. Feature Extraction: Computes dwell time (press duration), flight time (gap between key presses), and typing speed.  
3. Model Training: Uses ML algorithms to learn typing patterns.  
4. Evaluation: Assesses the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.  

Applications
User Authentication â€“ Secure logins based on typing behavior.  
Anomaly Detection â€“ Identify unusual typing patterns (fraud detection).  
Behavior Analysis â€“ Study cognitive states through typing patterns.
